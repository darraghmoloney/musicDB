# musicDB

A simple music database front-end. It doesn't really do much - just allows artist and album information to be added, deleted and updated.
It was made to practice using the MEAN stack and learn about how Angular does RESTful API calls.

The database backend is hosted on mongoDB cloud.

The REST Routes use Express with code live-hosted on repl.it.

Styling is from Semantic UI.
